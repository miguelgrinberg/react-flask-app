## Tips

A "key" is also known as a password. It is important you don't leak keys as hackers could do bad things with them. The best thing to do when you leak a key is to disable it and generate a new one.

This specific key allows us to connect to **The Open Movie Database** (OMDb) which is a database that has loads of different movies.

Look at [api.py](../api/api.py) and figure out where to add the key.
