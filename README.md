This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A Flask based API backend was added in the *api* directory.

Read my [tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-create-a-react--flask-project) on how to create Flask + React combined projects.


## Start API
```
cd api
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install flask python-dotenv requests
yarn start-api
```
