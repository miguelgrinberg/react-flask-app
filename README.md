# Movie Finder and Recommendation App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A Flask based API backend was added in the *api* directory.

Read the main [tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-create-a-react--flask-project) on how to create Flask + React combined projects.

## Start Flask API
```
cd api
source venv/bin/activate
yarn start-api
```

## Start React App
```
yarn start
```

## Before running Jupyter Notebook
```
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
