# Task: Change the size of the movie posters

### User description

As a user, I'd like to have a larger poster when I hover on it.

### To-do
-  Look for the code in the `App.css` file that defines the look of an element when you hover over it. Hint: Look at the class name used in the `MovieList` component when displaying the image. Look for a `:hover` selector in the css file.

-  Change the value of the transform scale to one of your liking
```css
	transform: scale(<NUMBER>);
```

### Files to change

- App.css
