# Task: Increase padding between movie posters

### User description

As a user, I want the movie posters to have more space in between. Not too spaced out, not too close together… something just right…

### To-do
- Add a line of code to set the amount of padding you would like to introduce by creating a new CSS class. For example:

```css
.sidepadding { padding-right: 20px; }
```

* Use the set amount of padding in MovieList.js component to add padding to the way movie posters list is displayed. For example:

```js
<div className='sidePadding'></div>
```

### Files to change

- App.css
- components/MovieList.js
