# Task: Change the heart colour for “Add to favourites”

### User description

As a user, I'd like to have a red heart icon when favoriting movies.

### To-do
-  Look for the code in the `AddFavourites.js` file that determines the fill color of the heart svg displayed when hovering on a movie. Change that to a color of your liking.

### Files to change

- src/components/AddFavourites.js
